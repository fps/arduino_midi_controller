# arduino_midi_controller

A simple MIDI controller sketch for a simple MIDI controller device. 

The master branch version now is changed for the Leonardo that has USB HID MIDI available.

# Requirements:

* An arduino of any kind
* 5 switches of the kind that open on press and close on release (or the other way around - need to adapt the code a little depending on which way around they are)
* Some cables
* Some soldering iron and lead
* The MIDIUSB library
